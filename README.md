# tivars_lib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adriweb/tivars_lib.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/adriweb/tivars_lib)
A PHP library to interact with TI-z80 (82/83/84 series) calculators files (programs, lists, matrices, etc.)

There is currently no other documentation than [the tests file](tests.php), which shows usage of the main API methods.

_Note: Not all var types are implemented yet._
